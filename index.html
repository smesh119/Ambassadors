                      The Red Hat Quality Engineering team is seeking a Senior Engineer to test our Linux platform. In this role, you'll work on a team that serves as the last gate through which code must pass on its way to public release. You'll perform function, integration, and performance testing on various tools in the Linux distribution, and track defects in system applications and daemons. We'll need you to have excellent technical skills, as you will develop test scripts and operate automated test suites to ensure the functionality of Red Hat products. This role is a great opportunity to be the first to experience new products and features before enterprise customers.
